      "text": "If Twitter's signals determine that an account might engage in harmful behavior, Twitter hides their replies behind a barrier and only loads them when \"Show more replies\" is clicked. This behavior is personalized, i.e. Twitter does not hide the tweets of accounts you follow. We therefore use an unbiased reference account without followings in order to determine whether tweets within a thread can be retrieved without clicking \"Show more replies\" from its view.\nIn some cases, Twitter classifies accounts to be offensive. In this case,replies are hidden behind a second barrier within the \"Show more replies\" section."

Twitter seems to take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis#Metrics\" target=\"_blank\">tie strength</a> or a similar metric into account. While an account may be suggested to users you are strongly tied to, it may not be shown to others."

It comprises a search ban while threads are completely ripped apart by hiding reply tweets of the affected user to others. Everything will look perfectly normal to the affected user but many others will not be able to see reply tweets of the affected user at all. Reasons for this ban include behavior like excessive tweeting or following. Again, this type of ban seems to be temporally limited for active accounts."
