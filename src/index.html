                    <p>
                      This type of ban causes your tweets to be hidden from the search results
                      entirely, no matter whether the quality filter is turned on or off.
                      This behavior includes hashtags as well. This type of ban seems to be
                      temporally limited for active accounts.

                    <p>
                      This is what is referred to as conventional shadowban as well. It comprises a
                      search ban while threads are completely ripped apart by hiding reply tweets
                      of the affected user to others. Everything will look perfectly normal to the
                      affected user but many others will not be able to see reply tweets of the
                      affected user at all. Reasons for this ban include behavior like excessive
                      tweeting or following. Again, this type of ban seems to be temporally limited
                      for active accounts.

                    <p>
                      QFD causes your tweets to be invisible within the latest section of the
                      search, including hashtags, when the quality filter is turned on. Note that
                      this quality filter is located on the search page, is turned on by default
                      and will be reset for each search anew. It differs from the quality filter
                      controlling your notifications. QFD was introduced on 15 May 2018 as part of
                      Twitter's so-called <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html">healthy conversation project</a>.

                            The quality filter within your notification settings only controls the
                            notification you receive. Turning it off is recommended and will cause you
                            to see more notifications which you would not have received otherwise.
                            However, turning it off will not cause your own tweets to be more visible.

                            A lot of interaction with accounts affected by QFD will likely cause your
                            account to be affected by QFD soon, too. The absence of personal misbehavior
                            does not guarantee an account to be unaffected.

                          <p>
                            Several German Twitter users that were affected by QFD have been
                            experimenting with an Arabic follow-back botnet.
                            The botnet generated a lot of followers for those who followed some
                            accounts from this botnet. By accumulating many new followers that were not
                            affected by QFD, at least 30 accounts were able to escape this type of ban.
                            This is a strong hint that guilt by association is a major concept of the
                            classifying algorithm.
                          </p>

                            The quality filter indeed seems to mainly affect conservative and right-wing
                            accounts. Testing over 2,000 contacts of two German left-wing extremist
                            accounts did not yield a single account affected by QFD that would not be
                            considered politically right. Testing 509 Twitter accounts from German
                            members of Parliament yielded 14 affected accounts. All of them belong to
                            the AfD, which is a German right-wing party.
                          </p>

                          <span>Does it only affect hashtags and the search? Why is it so bad then?</span>

                            We cannot tell whether the effects of QFD are limited to hashtags and the
                            search. These are only the symptoms making the ban visible to us. It shows
                            that Twitter is capable and willing to discriminate accounts with certain
                            political opinions. Since shadowbanning is a very unethical way to silence
                            people already, it is possible for Twitter to apply methods that are harder
                            to detect. Think of more subtle ways of banning by limiting the share of
                            followers who a user's tweets are shown to. This would be a censorship
                            method that could only be detected collectively by their followers.
