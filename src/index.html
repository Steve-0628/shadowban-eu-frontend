                This type of ban causes your tweets to be hidden from the search results
                entirely, no matter whether the quality filter is turned on or off.
                This behavior includes hashtags as well. This type of ban seems to be
                temporally limited for active accounts.

              <p>
                This is what is referred to as conventional shadowban as well. It comprises a
                search ban while threads are completely ripped apart by hiding reply tweets
                of the affected user to others. Everything will look perfectly normal to the
                affected user but many others will not be able to see reply tweets of the
                affected user at all. Reasons for this ban include behavior like excessive
                tweeting or following. Again, this type of ban seems to be temporally limited
                for active accounts.

              <h5>Quality Filter Discrimination</h5>
              <p>
                QFD causes your tweets to be invisible within the latest section of the
                search, including hashtags, when the quality filter is turned on. Note that
                this quality filter is located on the search page, is turned on by default
                and will be reset for each search anew. It differs from the quality filter
                controlling your notifications. QFD was introduced on May 15, 2018 as part of
                Twitter's so-called <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html">healthy conversation project</a>.

                    <p>
                      The quality filter within your notification settings only controls the
                      notification you receive. Turning it off is recommended and will cause you
                      to see more notifications which you would not have received otherwise.
                      However, turning it off will not cause your own tweets to be more visible.

                      A lot of interaction with accounts affected by QFD will likely cause your
                      account to be affected by QFD soon, too. The absence of personal misbehavior
                      does not guarantee an account to be unaffected.

                    <p>
                      Several German Twitter users that were affected by QFD have been
                      experimenting with an Arabic follow-back botnet.
                      The botnet generated a lot of followers for those who followed some
                      accounts from this botnet. By accumulating many new followers that were not
                      affected by QFD, at least 30 accounts were able to escape this type of ban.
                      This is a strong hint that guilt by association is a major concept of the
                      classifying algorithm.

                      The quality filter indeed seems to mainly affect conservative and right-wing
                      accounts. Testing over 2,000 contacts of two German left-wing extremist
                      accounts did not yield a single account affected by QFD that would not be
                      considered politically right. Testing 509 Twitter accounts from German
                      members of Parliament yielded 14 affected accounts. All of them belong to
                      the AfD, which is a German right-wing party.

                    <p>
                      We cannot tell whether the effects of QFD are limited to hashtags and the
                      search. These are only the symptoms making the ban visible to us. It shows
                      that Twitter is capable and willing to discriminate accounts with certain
                      political opinions. Since shadowbanning is a very unethical way to silence
                      people already, it is possible for Twitter to apply methods that are harder
                      to detect. Think of more subtle ways of banning by limiting the share of
                      followers who a user's tweets are shown to. This would be a censorship
                      method that could only be detected collectively by their followers.

              <h5>Search Ban</h5>
              <p>
                The Twitter search features several search modifiers. One of them is the prefix from:
                which allows to search for tweets from a specific user. For example, when checking
                whether
                <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu">
                  @shadowban_eu
                </a>
                has a shadowban, we query the Twitter search for
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=from%3A%40shadowban_eu&src=typd&qf=off">
                  from:@shadowban_eu
                </a>.
                If we do not find any tweets although the user has
                tweeted in the past, the account is subject to a search ban.
              </p>
              <h5>Thread Ban</h5>
              <p>
                When the user has a search ban, the tester searches their profile for the latest
                tweet with at least one reply. It then visits the direct URL of the tweet and
                selects some reply tweet. Afterwards, the direct URL of the reply tweet is visited.
                If the tweet that the user replied to is not visible, the likelihood that the
                account is affected by a thread shadowban is very high.
              </p>
              <h5>QFD</h5>
              <p>
                When you upload an image, cite a tweet or link to an external page, Twitter generates
                a shortlink for that content.
              </p>
              <p>
                We first find a reference tweet using a combination of from: and filter: search
                modifiers. For example,
                <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3A%40shadowban_eu%20filter%3Alinks&src=typd">
                  from:@shadowban_eu filter:links
                </a>
                returns all tweets from
                <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu">
                  @shadowban_eu
                </a>
                containing a link.
              </p>
              <p>
                We simply pick one result tweet as
                reference and extract the shortlink, e.g.
                <a href="https://t.co/5Vzu63ypQJ">
                  https://t.co/5Vzu63ypQJ
                </a>.<br />
                (This link points to a tweet, quoted <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowban_eu/status/1019242190277697538">here</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                We then query the Twitter search for the tweet using the shortlink's URL
                with the quality filter turned on and off.
                If the reference tweet is found in both
                cases, the account is not affected by QFD. In case it is found only when the filter
                is turned off, it is affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                We chose this method because shortlinks are unique. Methodically, it does not differ
                from searching for text or a hashtag but the uniqueness of shortlinks is a technical
                advantage.
